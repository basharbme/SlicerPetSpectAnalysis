Phantom Generation Steps.

In the MatlabCodes folder:

1) Run TACsGenerationScript.m :
	-This generates a TACs.mat file with the frame Times and the Time activity curves.

2) Run ActivityMapGenScript.m:
	-Generates the Activity Maps for each frame. The output files are vascFantom_.yaff where _ is frame number and .yaff the format 	 required by ASIM.
	-Generates the "TrueCounts_list.txt" that specifies the true number of counts to simulate for each frame.
** This files are stored in a folder called "ActivityOutput". **

3) Inside the folder "ActivityOutput" copy all the files contained in the "SimulationScripts" Folder.

4) Run the ASIM_scriptSimulation.sh file.
	-This generates one folder for each frame that contains each sinogram and reconstructed image. This folders are called "OutputN_" where "_" is frame number.
	-Make sure you have previously installed STIR and ASIM and have specified the paths in ASIM_scriptSimulation.sh.

5) Run the store_dPETsimulated.sh file.
	-This saves all the reconstructed images (ECAT format) in a folder called "dPET_simulated".
